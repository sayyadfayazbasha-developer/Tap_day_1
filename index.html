<pres>Pawan Kalyan’s New Movie & Recent Film Career (2025-26)

Pawan Kalyan — popularly known as Power Star — is one of Telugu cinema’s most iconic actors, known for his intense
screen presence, charismatic dialogue delivery, and mass appeal. After focusing heavily on his political career in
recent years — including serving as Deputy Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh — fans were unsure if he would continue his
film journey. However, in early 2026 he surprised everyone by officially announcing a new movie project, showing his
continued commitment to cinema alongside politics.
